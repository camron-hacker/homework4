^ Page Size

Alright, you may be thinking: "what?"
Yeah, I think it may be something to do with my bit math or my handling of the page numbering. Some of them are kinda close, if you squint. 
But the exam is soon and I cannot spend too much time thinking about this when my partner won't even respond to me.
So my analysis goes like this: The more pages there are in memory, i.e. the greater the disparity between memory size and page size, the more beneficial the output.
There are many many page faults for 64/64. But for something like 256 (ideally...) there would be fewer page faults.
This makes sense because page faults are caused by a lack of the page being stored in the table. Therefore, when there are many pages stored in the table, we get fewer of them.
